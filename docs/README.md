# SHGame Documentation

This directory contains all game development documentation for the SHGame Unity 2D PC single-player project. These documents are designed to be read and referenced by AI programmers and GitHub Agents for code management and quality assurance.

## Documentation Structure

### 📋 Design Documents
- **[Game Design Document (GDD)](design/GDD.md)** - Complete game design specification including gameplay mechanics, features, and requirements
- **[Technical Design Document (TDD)](technical/TDD.md)** - Technical architecture, systems design, and implementation guidelines  
- **[Art Bible](art/ArtBible.md)** - Visual style guide, asset specifications, and artistic direction

## Usage for AI Agents

These documents serve as the source of truth for:
- ✅ Code review and validation against design requirements
- 🎯 Feature implementation verification  
- 🏗️ Architecture compliance checking
- 🎨 Asset and visual consistency validation
- 📊 Progress tracking against defined milestones

## Development Workflow

1. **Design Phase**: Update GDD/TDD/Art Bible before implementation
2. **Implementation**: Code against documented specifications
3. **Review**: AI agents validate code against documentation requirements
4. **Iteration**: Update docs as design evolves
