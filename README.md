**Unity 2D PC Single-Player Indie Game**

A small-scale 2D single-player game developed with Unity 6000+ and Visual Studio 2022, designed for PC platforms.

## 🎮 Project Overview

This repository contains a Unity 2D game project with integrated AI-assisted development workflows using GitHub Agents for code management and quality assurance.

## 📚 Documentation

All game development documentation is located in the [`/docs`](docs/) directory:

- **[Game Design Document (GDD)](docs/design/GDD.md)** - Complete game design specification
